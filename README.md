# multi_agent_with_obstacle_avoidance
Designed a control mehtod using Matlab for robots so that they are able to form a defined shape, subsequently, Artificial Potential Field method was applied for robots to avoid obstacles

- In this project, a method of combining second- order formation control with path planning was introduced.
- the method uses adjacency matrix to generate the system equation
- Artificial potential field was been used for path planning, more percisely, avoiding obstacles.
- Project report can be found in the file list
